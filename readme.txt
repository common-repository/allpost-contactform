You can add a confirmation window and a submission window to your own html form(s) which you created, and send the data to a certain E-mail address.


== Description ==
Your site-visitors input data into your html form which you set. Then, firstly, this plugin creates a confirmation window to receive the data and displays the received data to your visitors as a table. Secondly, when your site-visitors push the submit-button on the confirmation window, this plugin creates a submission successfully window and displays it to your site-visitors. Finally, this plugin sends the data to your E-mail Address as an E-mail.

- See the DEMO
https://www.secure-formmail.net/?tag=demo-of-all-post-contact-form

(A) contact form(s) which send(s) all data submitted by POST method as (an) E-mail(s). Make your html form freely, as many forms as you like, by using input, textarea, checkbox, and so on. Each of the elements has "name=" & "value=". "name=" is an element you set. For example:
<pre><code>
<input type="text" name="realname">
<input type="text" name="phone-number">
</code></pre>

"value=" is an element your site-visitors will input into. 

For each of the form-elements you set, if your site-visitors input any data, this plugin makes "name=" & "value=" into a line like this:

realname： Exellentis Wordpresley 
phone-number： 123-4567-8910

And this plugin creates "Confirmation Window" and "Submission Window", and displays form elements via POST method as a table on each of the windows. Finally, this plugin sends the data to your E-mail Address as an E-mail.
